That said, I would still like to expose it publicly as a convenience. What I would like to know for sure is if I can refactor PowerCollections (e.g. split Algorithms class in smaller parts, change the namespace/class/method names, etc.) and distribute said modifications, both in binary and source form, given that I include the original license and copyright notices, and clearly annotate where I modified the original source code. Reading the EPL, I am guessing the answer is yes, but I would like a confirmation of that as I am not 100% sure. Thank you.",
